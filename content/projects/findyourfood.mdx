I designed a ReactNative app called FindYourFood (as part of Stanford CS 47 class) that makes recipe searching and grocery shopping simpler. Users can search for a recipe directly, or upload a picture of food to find a matching recipe, and add ingredients to their shopping list! The app also returns the closest grocery stores to a user.
