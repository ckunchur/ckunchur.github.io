## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a recent study published in Nature [1], which investigated the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for mental health interventions. The study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to provide emotional support and personalized guidance to individuals. The findings highlighted the promise of AI chatbots in:

- Enhancing accessibility: Offering 24/7 support, overcoming geographical limitations and potentially reducing therapy costs.
- Promoting self-discovery: Enabling users to gain insights into their emotions and thought patterns through reflection and journaling prompts.
- Providing personalized support: Tailoring responses and guidance based on user input, creating a more individualized experience compared to traditional therapy resources.

We believe that Mindstorm can build upon this research by developing a comprehensive AI-powered mental wellness companion. Our app aims to address the limitations identified in the study, such as:

- **Limited emotional understanding:** By incorporating advanced emotional recognition techniques, we can create AI companions that can better respond to user emotions, addressing people who might not want to see a real therapist/had bad experiences with therapy.
- **Focus on short-term interactions:** We aim to provide long-term support through features like weekly analysis and goal-setting tools.

Our vision is to create a user-friendly and accessible tool that empowers individuals on their journey towards mental well-being.

## Problem

Mental health concerns are prevalent, with anxiety affecting over 264 million people globally, according to WHO. Yet, accessing effective care remains a challenge. Cost, scheduling difficulties, and social stigma create major barriers.

The result? People struggling the most are often the least likely to seek help. Over 54% of adults with mental illness don’t seek treatment (WHO). This creates a vicious cycle, impacting their overall well-being, relationships, and physical health.

Mindstorm is here to break free from the limitations of traditional therapy. We offer personalized, accessible support through an accessible on-the-go app. Forget one-size-fits-all: we use LLMs with specialized chatbots tailored to address specific needs: ADHD, depression, anxiety, and productivity goals. The App Store and GPT Store are flooded with generic mental wellness chatbots. We offer something fundamentally different: precise support tailored to your specific needs.

## Differentiators

We have a pipeline and a specialized companion for every need, with long-term adaptive memory. With RAG-powered personalization, the companion you talk to analyzes your chat history, experiences, struggles, and preferences, allowing it to provide targeted support that resonates with your unique needs.

Unlike generic apps with a one-size-fits-all therapist, Mindstorm evolves with you. It’s your personalized mental health partner, offering ongoing guidance and a safe space to work towards your goals.

## Usage

Our user flow is simple — journal and reflect on your day, and choose to chat from your entry with a recommended companion based on what we detected from your needs. Over time, you can check your weekly insights to make sense of your trends and emotional landscape.

Imagine a companion that not only listens, but truly remembers. Unlike basic chatbots, Mindstorm utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to:

- **Personalize Your Experience:** We analyze your interactions, preferences, and past entries to tailor responses and support that hits home for you.
