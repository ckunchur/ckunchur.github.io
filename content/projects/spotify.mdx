# Summary

As part of my Intro to UI/UX Design class (CS 91SI), we learned best practices for designing effective user interfaces and experiences through topics including design patterns, interaction patterns, consistent decision making, design systems and UI models, and animation prototyping. With hands on projects in Figma, we redesigned features of Spotify and followed a PRD for suggestion of a new feature to boost Spotify Premium membership.

# Stage 1: Screen Recreation
Below are Figma recreations of a Spotify home page and "liked songs" page, created using autolayout boxes and Spotify typography/iconography.

# Stage 2: Spotify Social
Below is my suggested design for a new "Spotify Social" feature – an integrated space that lets users have more defined profiles, boost interaction with friends, more easily compare listening activity, and compete for awards and rankings. The Social "Home" page displays listening activity for friends, a leaderboard based on listening activity, and Blend – a more prominent/visible version of the current Spotify blend feature. Users also have a more detailed "Social" profile page and a new Social "Awards" page that gamifies the listening experience.
