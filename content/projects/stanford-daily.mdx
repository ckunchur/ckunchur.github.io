# Summary
During the 2021-2022 school year, I helped launch a major redesign of the Stanford Dailyâ€™s website, providing content to readers in a more engaging and accessible manner. Through this project, I gained experience in not only specific tools such as Figma and WordPress, but I have also improved my awareness and empathy for delivering to a diverse user and readership base.
My specific tasks included header, footer, and meta box redesign.

# Stanford Dish blog site concepts
I also worked on some designs for a then-planned Daily blog site.
